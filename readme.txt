A simple plugin to enable short codes in bbPress topics and replies.

== Description ==

This add-on plugin for bbPress is extremely simple and does one thing: parses short codes placed in topic and reply content.

By default bbPress does not render short codes placed into forum posts; this enables short codes. That's it.

**Disclaimer**: with this plugin enabled, all users will be able to use short codes, not just admins and editors.
